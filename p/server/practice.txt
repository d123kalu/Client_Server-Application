nglish essayists included Robert Burton (1577–1641) and 
Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682). In France, Michel de Montaigne's 
three volume Essais in the mid 1500s contain over 100 examples widely
 regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay. In Italy, Baldassare
 Castiglione wrote about courtly manners in his essay Il Libro del oregano.
 In the 17th century, the Jesuit Baltasar Gracián wrote about the theme of wisdom.[5]
 During the Age of Enlightenment, essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed 
at convincing readers of their position; they also featured heavily in the rise of 
periodical literature, as seen in the works of Joseph Addison, Richard Steele and Samuel Johnson.
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Edmund Burke and Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote essays 
for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great 
essayists in English – William Hazlitt, Charles Lamb, Leigh Hunt and Thomas de Quincey all 
penned numerous essays on diverse subjects. In the 20th century, a number of essayists tried 
to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays (e.g., T.S. Eliot). Whereas some 
essayists used essays for strident political themes, Robert Louis Stevenson and Willa Cather wrote l
ighter essays. Virginia Woolf, Edmund Wilson, and Charles du Bos wrote literary criticism essays.[5]
