1.For the code to run, you need to change all the pathnames in both p and Assigment2
  to match the directory of your computer on the desktop
2.Assignment2 is acting as the client while p is acting as the Server, so run p first
  then Assignment2.
3.The code doesnt work because the Server is having a hard time connecting to the Client.
